#### A Unicode compatible heiroglyphic script for toki pona

Are you frustrated that your favorite logographic script for Toki Pona isn't Unicode compatible? Do you think setelen Emosi is just a bit too legible and easy to type? Do you wish it was backwards compatible with an already established numbering system? sitelen Keme is for you!

sitelen Keme only uses charicters in the unicode block U+13000-1342F: Egyptian Hieroglyphs. Keme being from Kemet, the endonym for Ancient Egypt. It could also be "ma pimeja", and therefore "sitelen pimeja".

The hieroglyphs chosen were a mix of what looked kinda close to sitelen pona, and what the glyph means in Ancient Egyptian*, with a couple of jokes tossed in to keep me sane. Enough of a compromize to make both sides unhappy with my choices. As mentioned above, it is fully backwards-compatible with the traditional Ancient Egyptian numeral system, which is pretty friendly to understand as it is base-10. It also does not attatch "ale" to a specific number, though it does attach "mute" to 1 million and oddly, "sina" to 10 thousand.

I've only made the glyphs for the following categories, according to nimi.li as of Feb 2024 :
- core
- widespread
- common
- uncommon

These cover all the words I use, plus some. I'm not that familiar with almost any words more obscure than that. If you'd like to give it a shot, please do! Fork this project or submit a pull req!

# Names
Names are to follow a head noun as normal, and a half-cartouche character is to be at either end:

𓍹𓍺

These are specific. If you use the latter one backwards, it means nimisin.
If you prefer to use sitelen kalama to write names, use the dots below for the morae, and the walking stick for the whole word:

𓃉 𓃊 𓃋 𓃌 𓃍 𓃎 𓃏 𓃐 𓃑

𓌃

*based on the lists of glyphs on the sites below:
- https://www.egyptianhieroglyphs.net/gardiners-sign-list/
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Egyptian_hieroglyphs

** Since the first person pronoun and the word for person are the same heiroglyph, you can write only one where two would have been needed. "mi jan Emeli" => "𓀀 𓍸𓏙𓁐𓌃𓍻". This does not carry the same gendered implications as it originally does in Ancient Egyptian texts.

*** tonsi can be any character in section C: Anthropomorphic Deities (U+1305A-75), except Hah (U+13068), as he's already "mute".
